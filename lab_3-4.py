x = math.ceil(7.15)
#I believe that x will eqaul out to be 8; to which was correct
print (x)
a = math.floor(19.156)
#a will be 19; which was right
print (a)
b = math.fabs(-42)
#b will be 42; correct
print (b)
c = math.pow(2, 3)
#c will equal 8; correct
print (c)
d = math.log10(100)
#d will equal 10; the correct answer is 2
print (d)
e = math.sqrt(9)
#the answer for e will be 3; correct
print (e)
f = math.isqrt(2)
#f will equal 2; the correct asnweer is 1
